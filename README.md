<p align="center">

_A collection utilities for architecting SwiftUI apps in the Redux/Elm style of Reducers, Actions, Side Effects and Middlewares._

<p />


## Installation

### Xcode Projects

Select `File` -> `Swift Packages` -> `Add Package Dependency` and enter `https://github.com/CypherPoet/CypherPoetReduxUtils`.


### Swift Package Manager Projects

You can add `CypherPoetReduxUtils` as a dependency in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
let package = Package(
    //...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/CypherPoet/CypherPoetReduxUtils", from: "0.1.0"),
    ],
    //...
)
```

Then simply `import CypherPoetReduxUtils` wherever youâ€™d like to use it.


## Usage

The goal of these utilities is to serve as _primitives_ for architecting SwiftUI apps in the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)/[Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/) style of Reducers, Actions, Side Effects and Middlewares.

Check out the main [Example App](./Examples/ExampleApp) to see how it [composes different types of app `State` into an app `Store`](https://github.com/CypherPoet/CypherPoetReduxUtils/blob/57cbb225c896181083972a298d8952e8feb14826/Examples/ExampleApp/Shared/Data/State/AppState.swift#L16), [injects](https://github.com/CypherPoet/CypherPoetReduxUtils/blob/57cbb225c896181083972a298d8952e8feb14826/Examples/ExampleApp/Shared/ExamplesApp.swift#L25) that store [into views](https://github.com/CypherPoet/CypherPoetReduxUtils/blob/57cbb225c896181083972a298d8952e8feb14826/Examples/ExampleApp/Shared/Scene%20Views/AsyncSideEffectExample.swift#L13) as an `@EnvironmentObject`, and then [sends actions to the store](https://github.com/CypherPoet/CypherPoetReduxUtils/blob/57cbb225c896181083972a298d8952e8feb14826/Examples/ExampleApp/Shared/Scene%20Views/AsyncSideEffectExample.swift#L85) as a response to events in the UI.

## Acknowledgments

This project wouldn't be possible without a number of enlightening projects, articles and tutorials by others in the Swift community who latched on to using these patterns in SwiftUI. Here are some of its main inspirations:
